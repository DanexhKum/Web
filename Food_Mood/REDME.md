
## Mood-Based Recipe Generator

This project offers a unique experience by generating personalized recipe suggestions based on the user's mood, which is detected through their voice. The user simply speaks into the application, and it analyzes the tone and sentiment of the voice to determine their emotional state. Based on this, the app suggests recipes that align with the user’s mood, whether they're feeling happy, sad, stressed, or energized.

### Features:

* **Voice-based Mood Detection**: The application uses speech recognition to analyze the user's tone and sentiment, detecting their current mood.
* **Mood Input**: Users can also manually select their mood, in case they prefer not to use the voice input.
* **Recipe Recommendations**: Based on the detected or selected mood, the app suggests recipes tailored to enhance the user’s emotional state or meet their needs.
* **Recipe Details**: The app provides detailed ingredients, cooking instructions, and nutritional information for each suggested recipe.
* **User-friendly Interface**: A simple and intuitive design that makes it easy to navigate and use.

### Technologies Used:

* **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* **Backend**: Node.js
* **Voice Recognition**: Web Speech API or third-party libraries for mood analysis from voice
* **APIs**: External APIs for recipe data and mood-based recipe matching
